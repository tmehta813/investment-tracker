# Investment Tracker

Welcome to the **Investment Tracker** project! 
## Project Structure

The project is organised into several packages to promote clean code and adhere to best practices. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the package structure and their responsibilities:

### App

- **MainActivity**: The entry point of the application. It sets up the initial configuration.

### Core

- **common**
  - **models**: Contains data models shared across different features of the app.
  - **UiState**: Manages the state using a sealed class
    - **Data**: When the data has successfully loaded and ready to display to user.
    - **Error**: When an error has occurred and an error messages needs to be displayed.
    - **Loading**: Show loader to user When data is still being fetched.

### Feature

#### Common

- **common**: Contains shared components, utilities used across different features.

#### Details

- **data**
  - **Repo**: Interface for data operations related to investment details.
  - **RepoImpl**: Implements the `Repo` interface, handling data operations with a mock data source.

- **presentation**
  - **ui**: Contains ui components for details screens. For eg. 
  - **ViewModel**: Manages UI-related data and business logic for the investment details screens.
  - **PageEvent**: Defines events within the investment details feature, such as `FetchDetailsEvent` to fetch details of a selected investment.

#### Home

- **data**
  - **Repo**: Interface for data operations related to the home screen.
  - **RepoImpl**: Implements the `Repo` interface, handling data operations with a mock data source.

- **presentation**
  - **ui**: Contains all screens related to the home feature.
  - **ViewModel**: Manages UI-related data and business logic for the home screens.
  - **PageEvent**: Defines events within the home feature.

## Key Features

1. **Unidirectional Workflow**:
   - The app uses a unidirectional data flow architecture with Jetpack Compose, Flow, Coroutines, and Dagger Hilt for dependency injection. This architecture uses data flow and and update state using state management.

2. **Architecture Layers**:
   - **UI Layer**: Built with Jetpack Compose, this layer contains all the ui.
   - **ViewModel Layer**: Manages UI-related data and business logic, interacting with the repository to fetch or update data.
   - **Repository Layer**: Acts as the data source, currently using a mock implementation to provide data to the ViewModel.

3. **Design Principles**:
   - **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class and module has a single responsibility, ensuring a clean and manageable codebase (e.g., UI, ViewModel, Repo, Data Source).
   - **Interface Segregation Principle**: Interfaces are designed to meet the specific needs.For example, (HomeRepo and DetailRepo) each focus on their own distinct tasks.
   - **Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level modules depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, managed by Dagger Hilt (e.g., HomeRepo, DetailsRepo, InvestmentApi).
